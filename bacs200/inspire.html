          A hero is someone who is inspires others to live their lives rightiously.
          Heroes are teachers who are kind and understanding. We can get a slight insight
          of a person based on who they have elected as a hero.
     </p>
     <p> 
         The hero that I admire the most has the following characteristics.
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Charismatic leader - preaches sermons that are relatable</li>
       <li>Strong foundation - built something enormous from nothing</li>
       <li>Change - impacts many lives that need Jesus</li>
        <li>Intergrity - he lives true to his calling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Over the past year I have listend to majority of Steven's podcasts. He has grown to be my hero, 
      his sermons are humble and relatable. He amplifies the word of the Lord and is a righteous man. 
      Steven preaches about issues in the world today that need to be addressed in a Godly manner. He
      is someone many look up to.
